# biz_stats_ml
Program that produces retail/wholesale trade statistics using machine learning + visualisations 

The code uses confidential data and will not run simply by cloning this repo. But I will demonstrate what the code is doing here in this ReadMe file:

Visualisations:

Several visualisations are used to analyse the data on an industry level. The plots are interactive, the user can select years, chart-types, focus variables etc. Some visualisations are animated and if the user presses play, they will see changes overtime. Here are what some of the outputs look like (which would naturally adjust if something different was selected in the dropdown menus. 

Simple plots:
